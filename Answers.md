1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    **Server-side routing refers to the typical behavior that we see with most websites, where we navigate to a certain webpage, request data from that webpage and the server returns to us a document or HTML file that the browser then renders to the screen. Every link we click on a server-side routed website will repeat this behavior, typically reloading an entire page every time. Client-side routing refers to the method of using JS within a client app/website to manage its own memory so that the browser doesnâ€™t need to reload any data to render different pages. Client-side routing will be slower at first render, but faster during routing; server-side routing has a fast first render but is slower at routing. Also server-side routing is more SEO-friendly.**
